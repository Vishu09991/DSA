Like What kiind of ques are asked and from whats topics

Good question — sorting questions are a BIG interview favorite, especially for CS/IT + product/FinTech roles 👍
Let me break it down interview-style, clean and practical.

🔹 How Sorting Questions Are Asked in Interviews

They usually come in 3 forms 👇

1️⃣ Direct Algorithm Questions

They check basics + understanding

Examples:

Explain Insertion Sort / Merge Sort / Quick Sort

Write code for Bubble Sort

Which sorting algorithm is stable?

Which one works best for nearly sorted arrays?

Time & space complexity of Merge Sort?

👉 Expect follow-ups, not just definition.

2️⃣ Problem-Solving Using Sorting

Sorting is used as a tool, not the final answer.

Examples:

Find 2nd largest element

Check if array elements form a pair with given sum

Merge two sorted arrays

Sort an array of 0s, 1s, 2s

Find minimum difference pair

💡 Interviewer wants to see:

Why you chose sorting

Can it be optimized without sorting?

3️⃣ Tricky / Conceptual Questions

These test depth, not memorization.

Examples:

Why is Quick Sort faster in practice than Merge Sort?

Why is Merge Sort preferred for linked lists?

Why can’t Counting Sort be used everywhere?

Is std::sort() stable?

Can sorting be done in O(n)?

🔹 Topics You MUST Prepare for Sorting
✅ Core Sorting Algorithms (VERY IMPORTANT)
Algorithm	Asked?	Why
Bubble Sort	✅	Basics, swaps
Selection Sort	⚠️	Comparisons
Insertion Sort	✅✅	Best for nearly sorted
Merge Sort	✅✅	Divide & Conquer
Quick Sort	✅✅	Real-world use
Heap Sort	⚠️	Priority queues
✅ Time & Space Complexity

They always ask this.

Algorithm	Best	Avg	Worst	Space
Bubble	O(n)	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(1)
Insertion	O(n)	O(n²)	O(n²)	O(1)
Merge	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n)
Quick	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n²)	O(log n)
Heap	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	O(1)
✅ Stability & Adaptiveness (Interview FAV 🔥)

Stability → Equal elements keep their order
Adaptive → Faster if array is nearly sorted

Algorithm	Stable?	Adaptive?
Bubble	✅	✅
Insertion	✅	✅
Merge	✅	❌
Quick	❌	❌
Heap	❌	❌
🔹 Common Trick Questions

Why insertion sort is used in real systems?
→ Small datasets, cache friendly, nearly sorted

Why Quick Sort is preferred?
→ In-place, good cache performance

Why Merge Sort not used for arrays in practice?
→ Extra memory

When will Quick Sort give worst case?
→ Already sorted array + bad pivot

🔹 Languages-Specific Questions
C / C++

qsort() vs std::sort()

Is std::sort() stable? ❌

What algorithm does std::sort() use? → Introsort

Java

Collections.sort() → TimSort

Why TimSort? → Real-world partially sorted data

Python

sorted() uses TimSort

Why it is fast even though O(n log n)?

🔹 What Interviewers REALLY Want

✔ Can you explain the logic
✔ Can you trace the algorithm step-by-step
✔ Can you choose the right algorithm
✔ Can you optimize brute force

🔹 How YOU Should Prepare (Simple Plan)

1️⃣ Master Insertion, Merge, Quick
2️⃣ Write code without seeing
3️⃣ Practice 1 problem per algorithm
4️⃣ Always explain why this sort?

If you want, next I can:

Explain Insertion Sort step-by-step like interview

Give top 10 sorting interview questions

Do mock interview Q&A (you answer, I correct)

Just tell me 😄
